The Androgen Receptor (AR) is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. We evaluated AR protein expression in high-risk breast cancer treated in the adjuvant setting. Tumors were subtyped into luminal (ER+/Pg+-/AR+-), molecular apocrine (MAC, [ER-/PgR-/AR+]) and hormone receptor negative carcinomas (HR-negative, [ER-/PgR-/AR-]). Subtyping was evaluated with respect to prognosis and to taxane therapy. High histologic grade (p < 0.001) and increased proliferation (p = 0.001) more often appeared in MAC and HR-negative than in luminal tumors. Patients with MAC had outcome comparable to the luminal group, while patients with HR-negative disease had increased risk for relapse and death. MAC outcome was favorable upon taxane-containing treatment; this remained significant upon multivariate analysis for overall survival (HR 0.31, 95%CI 0.13-0.74, interaction p = 0.035) and as a trend for time to relapse (p = 0.15). In conclusion, AR-related subtyping of breast cancer may be prognostic and serve for selecting optimal treatment combinations.
